# # 🧠 LangChain with RAG

This project was developed to demonstrate the capabilities of LangChain when combined with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The application is designed to process web and PDF documents, particularly scientific articles, and generate contextually relevant responses using OpenAI's GPT-4 model.

## 🔍 Why This Project?

As the volume of scientific data continues to grow, efficiently retrieving and synthesizing relevant information becomes increasingly challenging. This project leverages the power of LangChain and RAG to enhance the way we interact with large language models, making it easier to extract valuable insights from vast amounts of unstructured data.

## 🌐 What is LangChain?

**LangChain** is a powerful framework designed to streamline the creation of applications that interact with large language models (LLMs). It allows developers to build complex chains of logic that can process, transform, and analyze text data in a highly flexible manner.

## 🔗 What is RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)?

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a method that combines the strengths of information retrieval and natural language generation. In a RAG system, relevant documents or text segments are first retrieved based on a query, and then a language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more accurate and contextually relevant response. This approach enhances the model's ability to provide precise answers, particularly in specialized domains like scientific research.

## 🚀 Features

- **🌐 URL Processing with RAG**: Extract and process content from scientific web pages, applying RAG techniques to generate contextually accurate and relevant responses.
- **📄 PDF Document Analysis**: Upload and analyze scientific PDFs, utilizing RAG to provide informed answers based on the document's content.
- **💬 Direct OpenAI Queries**: Query OpenAI's GPT-4 model directly, either with or without additional context from the provided documents.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **LangChain**: A robust framework for creating applications that interact with large language models (LLMs) using chains.
- **OpenAI GPT-4**: Provides the core language processing capabilities, enabling advanced question answering and content generation.
- **FAISS**: Utilized for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors, crucial for RAG functionality.
- **Streamlit**: A Python library used to create the interactive web interface for this application.
- **Python**: The main programming language used to integrate all the components.
